-- General use --
genShared.py should be used to parse an existing set of PDI and SDI test vectors created by cryptotvgen. This script
does not parse the DO file from the original set. The output files will be called "sharedPDI.txt" and "sharedSDI.txt".
The script requires a couple input parameters including the number of shares desired (supporting any number
from 2 to 4) and the I/O width of the PDI and SDI files being parsed. Other input parameters are optional,
allowing for further specification of the existing test vector files and the desired location of the shared
output files.

-- Shared test vector generation method --
The "fixed" input parameter supports a different method to generate the shared test vectors. If the "fixed" parameter
is set to True, then a single set of masks will be applied across all PDI test vectors and a different set of masks
will be applied across all SDI test vectors. This parameter defaults to false meaning that each test vector of both
the PDI and SDI files will have a new set of random masks applied.
